The Activities app is a small application to allow attendees to organize and plan small event in and around a conference. Users create events or sign up to created ones. Signup works through GitHub or Twitter.

The app is mobile friendly and easy to run on a free Heroku account.

## Donationware

The app was created by members on the Ruby Berlin e.V. on their free time as a community effort initially for the eurucamp conference. Ruby Berlin is the body behind RailsGirls Berlin and Hamburg, eurucamp and JRubyConf.eu.

If you end up using the app, please get in [contact](mailto:info@isleofruby.org) so that we know. Also, spread the word about our [projects](http://rubyberlin.org). Also, consider [donating](https://www.betterplace.org/en/organisations/ruby-berlin/), especially, if you run a commercial conference. We are a registered non-profit, donations are tax deducible. Betterplace handles all paperwork - if in doubt, send us a mail.

If you cannot or don't want to donate - use it, it's free.
